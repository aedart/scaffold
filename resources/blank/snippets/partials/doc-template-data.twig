    | Template Data
    | ------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | In this section, all the "variables" that are needed by
    | templates are defined. (Internally, these are called
    | "properties").
    |
    | Each defined variable or "property" has a type, that
    | determines how the system should deal with it. Depending on
    | that type, a value is either just passed on to the templates
    | or the end-user is prompted (asked) for a value, in the
    | console.
    |
    | By default, the system supports the types that are defined
    | within the Type interface.
    | @see \Aedart\Scaffold\Contracts\Templates\Data\Type
    | ------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Syntax
    |
    | As a minimum, each variable should be defined in the
    | following way;
    |
    | 'name-of-property' => [
    |      'value' => (the value of the property)
    | ],
    |
    | If you need the end-user to provide you with a value, then
    | you must state a type. It will determine how the user is
    | going to be asked for that value. Furthermore, additional
    | settings might be required, such as a 'question' property,
    | that is displayed to the user.
    |
    | 'name-of-property' => [
    |      'type'      => \Aedart\Scaffold\Contracts\Templates\Data\Type::QUESTION
    |      'question'  => 'The question to ask the user'
    |      'value'     => (default value, in case user just hits enter)
    | ],
    |
    | See the resources/examples/example.scaffold.php for what
    | settings are supported by the default types.
    | ------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Validation and post processing
    |
    | Validation and post-processing of the values is also
    | supported. This is done so, via callback methods.
    |
    | 'name-of-property' => [
    |      'type'          => \Aedart\Scaffold\Contracts\Templates\Data\Type::QUESTION
    |      'question'      => 'The question to ask the user'
    |      'value'         => (default value, in case user just hits enter),
    |      'validation'    => function($answer){return $answer;},
    |      'postProcess'   => function($answer){return $answer;},
    | ],
    | ------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Behind the scenes, the Symfony Style utility is used as a
    | helper to prompt the user for a value.
