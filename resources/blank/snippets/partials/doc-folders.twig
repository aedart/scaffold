    | Folders

    |
    | Each folder (or directory) stated in this array will be
    | created, if it does not already exist.
    |
    | NOTE: Directories are created from the current working
    | directory as the top-most level.
    |
    | Example:
    | Lets assume that you wish to create a set of predefined
    | directories in /home/projects/MyProject/.
    | When the scaffold CLI is executed, then all of the
    | below stated directories will be created inside the
    | mentioned root directory;
    |
    | /home/projects/MyProject/app/
    | /home/projects/MyProject/config/
    | /home/projects/MyProject/src/
    | /home/projects/MyProject/src/Contracts/
    | /home/projects/MyProject/src/Contracts/Controllers
    | ...etc
