    | Scaffold handlers
    | ------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | These handlers are used by some of the default tasks. They
    | provide an additional level of flexibility, in which you
    | can use the default tasks, yet change the way that each of
    | them handles certain operations.
    |
    | If you do not plan to change the default tasks' behaviour,
    | then you can leave out this part of the configuration.
