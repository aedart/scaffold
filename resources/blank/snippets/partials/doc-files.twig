    | Each file will be copied into your project directory,
    | if it does NOT already exist.
    |
    | WARNING: You should avoid large files. If your template
    | requires such, then you should perhaps consider a custom
    | command that can download them from an external source!
    |
    | NOTE: The files are read from inside the 'basePath'.
