    | Templates
    | ------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Think of these as snippets that will be used to generate
    | some kind of file. It could be a composer file, a PHP Class,
    | a .env configuration or perhaps a default README file.
    |
    | Each template has a source template file, e.g. a *.twig
    | file, a destination which you can prompt the user about,
    | before the file is generated.
    |
    | The "destination" property works just like the template
    | data. See "templateData" documentation for further info.
    |
    | Furthermore, the source and destination will assigned as a
    | template variable, and made available inside the template
    | itself!
    |
    | Example
    | 'composer' => [
    |      'source' => 'snippets/composer.json.twig'
    |      'destination' => [
    |          'value'       => 'composer.json'
    |      ],
    |      ...
    | ]
    |
    | Will be available inside the 'snippets/composer.json.twig'
    | template as {{ '{{ template.composer.source }}' }},
    | {{ '{{ template.composer.destination }}' }} ...etc
    | ------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Each destination that you provide (or ask for) is relative
    | to the "output path". This usually means the current working
    | directory of where the scaffold is being installed into!
