Requirements
============

* php version > 5.6.4
* `composer <https://getcomposer.org/>`_

This package uses `composer <https://getcomposer.org/>`_. If you do not know what that is or how it works, I recommend that you read a little about, before attempting to use this package.

Other than this, you scaffold application requires read / write access to the directories where you use it.
Normally this isn't a problem. However if you run into these kinds of issues, please review your PHP's access privileges.
